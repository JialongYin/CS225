Albert Einstein travels through the narrow passageway and he develops the "law of the photoelectric effect". Then he continue to walk and he sees two doors. The first, a large old oak door, is slightly ajar; the second, a narrow passageway that looks as though it leads into another hallway; and the third, a sterile metal door that is propped open with a large stone. Uncertain which way to travel, he takes a second to consider each choice.
