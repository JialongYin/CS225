Albert Einstein walks into a long hallway, where she sees three doors. The first, a large old oak door, is slightly ajar; the second, a narrow passageway that looks as though it leads into another hallway; and the third, a sterile metal door that is propped open with a large stone. Uncertain which way to travel, he takes a second to consider each choice.
