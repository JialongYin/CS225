Albert Einstein travels through the oak door and he develops the "theory of relativity". Then he continue to walk and he sees two doors. The first, a large old oak door, is slightly ajar; the second, a narrow passageway that looks as though it leads into another hallway. Uncertain which way to travel, he takes a second to consider each choice.
